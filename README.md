# Phishing-Website-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
The project is about identifying phishing web sites and providing with the possible targeted domain (parent of the clone page).\n
\n
The concerned objective has been achieved by analysing the URL-based features of the websites (pre-defined in the dataset). The project has been implemented using various ML algorithms in Python like Decision tree, Random forest, Multilayer Perceptron, XGBoost, AutoEncoder and SVM. Out of these, the best has later been chosen to work as the base algorithm for detecting phishing websites.\n
